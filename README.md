# OpenShift Deployment Patterns Index

Welcome to the OpenShift Deployment Patterns Index. This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to various patterns that can be applied to demonstrate efficiently deploying and managing services in OpenShift. 

It starts with bootstrapping an OpenShift cluster and progresses through a series of patterns designed to demonstrate deploying and running different types of services.

*This repository is not intended to promote one strategy over another. Instead, it aims to display a variety of approaches to solve common deployment and management challenges in OpenShift environments, providing users with insights and options to best suit their specific needs.*

## Bootstrapping OpenShift

The foundation of deploying services in OpenShift begins with setting up the cluster itself.  All repos are structured to be consumed by ArgoCD in an app-of-apps format.

To help configure the base environment to work with this format run the Ansible Plays to bootstrap the demo cluster with OpenShift GitOps and External Secrets Operators.
